When a callow young farmer shows himself to be completely uninterested in the sensitive art of milking a dairy cow, Aria, a bovine diva, along with her singing and dancing back up bulls, belts out a tune demanding to be respected for more than just dairy products. In the end, our young farmer learns to respect the collaborative effort that made Krelborn farms and its cows an award-winning dairy farm." %}
